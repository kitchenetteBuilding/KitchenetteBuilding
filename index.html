<p class="intro">During the 1960s, life was not easy for African Americans. They were treated with little respect and each day was a
    fight for their independence and freedom. There were many influential people who played a motivational role for African Americans.
    While some people used violence to gain their rights, other people used their voice and words to have an impact on the world.
    Poets were inspiring and many people wrote poems as a way to express what their voices could not. One poet in particular,
    Gwendolyn Brooks, used her strong words to exemplify what living conditions were like for African Americans during the 1960s.
    Within her poem kitchenette building, she illustrates how the thought of a dream could become a reality. Brooks uses imagery
    involving cooking and colors to explain her thoughts. Throughout the poem, the author portrays how much responsibility a dream
    takes, but it seems almost impossible due to the harsh living conditions that the people live in. The poem comes to a halt at
    lines instead of thirteen, which is the length of a regular sonnet. This depicts that there is room at the end of the poem for
    hope, that a dream will become a reality.  Despite the harsh reality the author faces, she has a positive outlook that a
    dream is possible. </p>
<p class="intro">We chose annotations that support our thesis by demonstrating what life was like for African Americans in the 1960s
    during the Civil Rights movement. Living conditions were harsh and life was not easy for African Americans. This annotation is
    important because it is showing how their lives were which is a huge part of what the poem is about. We also chose annotations
    that involve life in a kitchenette building, which is important it describes a majority of what the poem is about. Another
    annotation we chose is about Martin Luther King and his work with the Civil Rights Movement across the United States. Martin
    Luther King was a key figure of the Civil Rights movement and his “I Have A Dream” speech is very known. We mention how Gwendolyn
    Brooks references Martin Luther King in her poem when she states how the word dream gives someone a giddy feeling. This annotation
    best supports our thesis because he is discussing how the thought of a dream could possibly turn into a reality. We are including
    images of kitchenette buildings and Martin Luther King. These will help to give a better visual of just how small and crowded
    buildings actually were and how conditions were in kitchenette buildings. Images of Martin Luther King will also give a better
    visual for the annotations that include information about his work in the Civil Rights movement. Our annotations provide a better
    understanding of the poem and we chose lines that will make the poem easier to comprehend. There are many different ways to look
    at the poem and our annotations show how the poem supports our thesis that a dream is able to form into a reality.</p>
